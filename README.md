# Project: Landing Page
The output for this project will be a basic landing page that replicates [this page design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) from The Odin Project (TOP).

This project is meant to showcase the HTML and CSS knowledge acquired from TOP's [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course. In particular, this project will feature basic knowledge of using flexbox to set page layout.
